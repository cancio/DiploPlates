  "readme": "## Sty â€“ Colorization and more for Node.js console output\n\n### Installation\n\nYou've got Node.js and [npm](http://npmjs.org), right? Then:\n\n    npm install sty\n\nYou'll also want [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org):\n\n    npm install coffee-script\n\n### Quick start\n\nUsing CoffeeScript:\n\n    sty = require 'sty'\n    console.log \"#{sty.red 'WARNING:'} Color is #{sty.green 'awesome!'}\"\n\nNesting works as you'd expect:\n\n    console.log \"#{sty.bgblack sty.bold \"#{sty.red 'U'}S#{sty.cyan 'A'}\"}\"\n\nYou can also use some pseudo-HTML, through `sty.parse`:\n\n    console.log sty.parse 'You are being <b>attacked</b> by the <b><yellow>great dragon</yellow>!</b>'\n\nForget valid XML; you can move tags around freely:\n\n    console.log sty.parse '<b>W<u>h</b>o</u>a'\n\nTags that aren't supported by sty are ignored (that is, `sty.parse '<foo>'` is just `'<foo>'`).\n\nIf you find yourself using `console.log sty.parse` a lot, you should probably try [styout](https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/styout).\n\n### Advanced usage\n\nIf you want to use ANSI codes directly, each is a valid `sty` function name; so, for instance, `sty[1]` is identical to `sty.bold`. You can also use these numbers as HTML tags, prefixed by `a` or `A`; for instance, you can get a blink effect with `<A5>`:\n\n  console.log sty.parse 'I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by <A5>madness</A5>, starving hysterical naked.'\n\n### More documentation\n\nFor a complete list of every function/tag name in sty, run demo.coffee (`coffee demo.coffee`) after installation.\n\n### Disabling Sty\n\nSty automatically disables fancy output when the console doesn't support it (that is, when Node's `tty.isatty(process.stdout)` is `false`). You can also manually use `sty.disable()` and `sty.enable()` to switch styling on/off.\n\n### License and credits\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 Trevor Burnham and made available under the MIT license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
